## Background

In todays mini project, we wil analyze candy data with exploratory graphics, basic statistics, correlation analysis and principal component analysis methods we have been learning.

## Data Import

```{r}
candy_file <- read.csv("Candy Mini-Project Data.txt")
candy <- read.csv("Candy Mini-Project Data.txt", row.names=1)
head(candy)
```

## What is the dataset?

Let's analyze our data.

> Q1. How many different candy types are in this dataset?

```{r}
nrow(candy)
```
There are 85 candy types in this dataset

> Q2. How many fruity candy types are in the dataset?

```{r}
sum(candy$fruity)
```

There are 38 fruity candy types

## Fav candy

We can find out the percentage of people who prefer this candy over another randomly chosen candy by using `winpercent`:

```{r}
candy["Twix", ]$winpercent
```
 
> Q3. What is your favorite candy (other than Twix) in the dataset and what is it’s winpercent value?

Kit Kat, and the winpercent is `r candy["Kit Kat", ]$winpercent`

> Q4. What is the winpercent value for “Kit Kat”?

Opps, it is `r candy["Kit Kat", ]$winpercent`. We got this using `candy["Kit Kat", ]$winpercent` and r in front of the code

> Q5. What is the winpercent value for “Tootsie Roll Snack Bars”?

`r candy["Tootsie Roll Snack Bars", ]$winpercent`. Not that many ppl like it


```{r}
library("skimr")
skim(candy)
```



> Q6. Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?

N_missing and complete_rate are either 0 or 1

> Q7. What do you think a zero and one represent for the candy$chocolate column?

Whether there was any data input in the data set


## Exploratory analysis
> Q8. Plot a histogram of winpercent values using both base R an ggplot2.

Lets do base R first:

```{r}
hist(candy$winpercent, breaks=25)
```
Now, let's do the ggplot:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(candy) +
     aes(winpercent)+
     geom_histogram(bins=12, fill="lightpink", col="red")
```

> Q9. Is the distribution of winpercent values symmetrical?

No, it is not (doesn't look like it)

> Q10. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?

It is above, we got it by using `mean`
```{r}
mean(candy$winpercent)
```
Not that good to use with non-normally distributed data:(
```{r}
summary()
```

> Q11. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit candy?

First, we gotta find all chocolate candy in the dataset -> extract their winpercent values -> calc the mean -> find alll fruit candy -> find their winpercent -> calc their mean

Steps 1-3:
```{r}
choc.candy <- candy[candy$chocolate==1,]
choc.win <- choc.candy$winpercent
mean(choc.win)
```
Let's do the same for the fruity candy (steps 3-6):

```{r}
fruit.candy <- candy[candy$fruity==1,]
fruit.win <- fruit.candy$winpercent
mean(fruit.win)
```
Sp, the chocolate candy is higher ranked than fruit candy (I agree)

> Q12. Is this difference statistically significant?

```{r}
t.test(choc.win, fruit.win)

```
So, the difference between the values is statisticlly significant


## Overall Candy Rankings

> Q13. What are the five least liked candy types in this set?

```{r}
inds <- order(candy$winpercent)
head(candy[inds, ], 5)
```
Nik L Nip, Boston Baked Beans, Chiclets, Super Bubble, Jawbusters
> Q14. What are the top 5 all time favorite candy types out of this set?

We do the same - but we meed top 5 candies
```{r}
inds_max <- rev(inds)        
head(candy[inds_max, ], 5)
```
We got: reese's peanut butter cup, reese's miniatures, twix, kit kat, snickers

> Q15. Make a first barplot of candy ranking based on winpercent values.


```{r}
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, rownames(candy)) +
  geom_col()

ggsave("barplot1.png",  height=10, width=4)
```
![](barplot1.png)


> Q16. This is quite ugly, use the reorder() function to get the bars sorted by winpercent?
